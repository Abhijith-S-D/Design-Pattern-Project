Life design pattern

The pattern stores objects of all the Factories that are registered with it. 
It maintains an object pool of every reusable object which are currently not in use.
To avoid representation, it maintains only one instance of every unique object that was created and currently not in use.
One can specify the size of this pattern i.e. maximum number of instances this can pool.
Once this number is reached, the oldest instance is destroyed.
Over this users can decide on the policy of destruction of an instance inside the pattern with added dependency on other 
instances or can even set the time of survival within the pool.
