Life design pattern

The pattern stores objects of all the Factories that are registered with it.
Only objects that extend Resources class can be put in the pattern. 
It maintains an object pool of every reusable object which are currently not in use.
To avoid recreation of heavy objects, it maintains instances of every unique object that was created and currently not in use.
While returning the objects to pool their values are reset.
One can set longetivity of the objects and these objects are destroyed according to their longetivity.
